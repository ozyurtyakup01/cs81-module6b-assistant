What made your assistant “personal” to you?
I wrote the code and what it prints out. That makes it personal enough

What challenges did you face using this?
Instead of predefined member variable names such as mName,"this" is used in js. Realizing that made things more clear

Which method would you improve or expand?
I didn't add condition check for completeTask for example. It will give undefined if I call it on an empty array. It is completely expandable adding dates,times etc. I just completed requirements mentioned in assignment.
